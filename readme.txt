WooCommerce Product Filter (WOOF) extension to display set of filters depending on current product category page.

== Description ==

WOOF by Category is a WooCommerce Product Filter (WOOF) extension, which allows user to set up different WOOF filters in different categories.

Plugin has options page on the backend, to setup relationships between any WooCommerce product category and any set of WOOF filters. Only selected filters will be shown on the selected category page and its children. Please see screenshots.

It is possible to set up any number of category->filters pairs.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 5.6 or greater (PHP 8.0 or greater is recommended)
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)
* WooCommerce 3.0 or greater
* WooCommerce Product Filter (WOOF) plugin

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself, and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WOOF by Category, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WOOF by Category” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use additional product taxonomies, not only product_cat?

Add this code to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
function wbc_product_categories_filter( $categories ) {
	return array_merge( $categories, [ 'tax-1', 'tax-2' ] );
}

add_filter( 'wbc_product_categories', 'wbc_product_categories_filter' );
`

where `tax-1`, `tax-2`, are additional product taxonomies to use with the plugin.

= Where can I get support or talk to other users? =
