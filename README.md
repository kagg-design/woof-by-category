## Contents

The WordPress Plugin WOOF by Category includes the following files:

* `.gitignore`. Used to exclude certain files from the repository.
* `CHANGELOG.md`. The list of changes to the core project.
* `README.md`. The file that you’re currently reading.
* A `plugin-name` directory that contains the source code - a fully executable WordPress plugin.

## Features

* The WOOF by Category is based on the [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API), [Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards), and [Documentation Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/).
* All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to be changed.
* The WOOF by Category uses a strict file organization scheme that correspond both to the WordPress Plugin Repository structure, and that make it easy to organize the files that compose the plugin.
* The project includes a `.pot` file as a starting point for internationalization.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/kagg-design/woof-by-category
cd woof-by-category
composer install --no-dev
```

## Recommended Tools

### i18n Tools

The WordPress Plugin WOOF by Category uses a variable to store the text domain used when internationalizing strings throughout the WOOF by Category. To take advantage of this method, there are tools that are recommended for providing correct, translatable files:

* [Poedit](https://poedit.net/)
* [makepot](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/)
* [i18n](https://github.com/grappler/i18n)

Any of the above tools should provide you with the proper tooling to internationalize the plugin.
